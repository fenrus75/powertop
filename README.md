# PowerTOP

PowerTOP is a Linux* tool used to diagnose issues with power consumption and
power management. In addition to being a diagnostic tool, PowerTOP also has an
interactive mode you can use to experiment with various power management
settings, for cases where the Linux distribution has not enabled those
settings.


# Build dependencies

PowerTOP is coded in C++. It was written for Linux-based operating systems.
GNU* libc (`glibc`) and Linux `pthreads` are needed for PowerTOP to function
properly. The GNU build system (`autoconf`, `automake`, `make`, `libtool`), as
well as `gettext`, are required to build PowerTOP.

In addition, PowerTOP requires the following:

* kernel version => 2.6.38
* `ncurses-devel` (required)
* `libnl-devel` (required)
* `pciutils-devel` (is only required if you have PCI)
* `autoconf-archive` (for building)
* `libtracefs` version => 1.3

Example packages to install in Ubuntu*:

    sudo apt install libpci-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev gettext \
    libgettextpo-dev autopoint gettext libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libtool-bin \
    dh-autoreconf autoconf-archive pkg-config libtraceevent-dev libtracefs-dev
    
Debian Bullseye can be updated from libtracefs 1.0 to libtracefs 1.5 using [backports](https://packages.debian.org/source/bullseye-backports/libtracefs). Newer Debian versions support a later version.

## Building PowerTOP

The `autogen.sh` script needs to be run only once to generate `configure`.
You need to re-run it only if the build system configuration files
(e.g. `configure.ac`) are modified. The remaining steps are required whenever
source files are modified.

To build PowerTOP from the cloned source, use the following commands:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make


# Running PowerTOP

The following sections go over basic operation of PowerTOP. This includes
kernel configuration options (or kernel patches) needed for full functionality.
Run `powertop --help` to see all options.


## Kernel parameters and (optional) patches

PowerTOP needs some kernel config options enabled to function
properly. As of linux-3.3.0, these are (the list probably is incomplete):

    CONFIG_NO_HZ
    CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS
    CONFIG_HPET_TIMER
    CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
    CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND
    CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE
    CONFIG_TIMER_STATS
    CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS
    CONFIG_PERF_COUNTERS
    CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS
    CONFIG_TRACING
    CONFIG_EVENT_POWER_TRACING_DEPRECATED
    CONFIG_X86_MSR
    ACPI_PROCFS_POWER
    CONFIG_DEBUG_FS

Use these configs from linux-3.13.rc1:

    CONFIG_POWERCAP
    CONFIG_INTEL_RAPL

The patches in the `patches/` sub-directory are optional but enable *full*
PowerTOP functionality.


## Outputting a report

When PowerTOP is executed as root and without arguments, it runs in
interactive mode. In this mode, PowerTOP most resembles `top`.

For generating reports, or for filing functional bug reports, there are two
output modes: CSV and HTML. You can set sample times, the number of iterations,
a workload over which to run PowerTOP, and whether to include
`debug`-level output.

For an HTML report, execute PowerTOP with this option:

    powertop --html=report.html

This creates a static `report.html` file, suitable for sharing.

For a CSV report, execute PowerTOP with this option:

    powertop --csv=report.csv

This creates a static `powertop.csv` file, also suitable for sharing.

If you wish to file a functional bug report, generate and share a
`debug`-mode HTML report and share it, using the following command:

    powertop --debug --html=report.html

**Important Note:** As PowerTOP is intended for privileged (`root`) use, your
reports-- especially when run with `--debug`-- will contain verbose system
information. PowerTOP **does not** sanitize, scrub, or otherwise anonymize its
reports. Be mindful of this when sharing reports.

**Developers:** If you make changes to the HTML reporting code, validate HTML
output by using the W3C* Markup Validation Service and the W3C CSS Validation
Service:
* http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload
* http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload


## Calibrating and power numbers

PowerTOP, when running on battery, tracks power consumption and activity on
the system. Once there are sufficient measurements, PowerTOP can start to
report power estimates for various activities. You can help increase the
accuracy of the estimation by running a calibration cycle at least once:

    powertop --calibrate

*Calibration* entails cycling through various display brightness levels
(including "off"), USB device activities, and other workloads.


## Extech Power Analyzer / Datalogger support

Our analysis teams use the Extech* Power Analyzer/Datalogger (model
number 380803). PowerTOP supports this device over the serial cable by passing
the device node on the command line using this command:

    powertop --extech=/dev/ttyUSB0

(where ttyUSB0 is the devicenode of the serial-to-usb adapter on our system)
