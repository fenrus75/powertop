powertop \- a power consumption and power management diagnosis tool.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B powertop
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B powertop
is a program that helps to diagnose various issues with power consumption
and power management.  It also has an interactive mode allowing one to
experiment with various power management settings.  When invoking
powertop without arguments powertop starts in interactive mode.
.SH OPTIONS

Set all tunable options to their good setting without interaction.
.TP
.B \-\-auto\-tune\-dump
Print
.I auto\-tune
commands to STDOUT instead of executing them.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-calibrate
Runs powertop in calibration mode.  When running on battery, powertop can
track power consumption as well as system activity.  When there are
enough measurements, powertop can start to report power estimates.  One
can get more accurate estimates by using this option to enable a
calibration cycle.  This will cycle through various display levels and
USB device activities and workloads.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-csv\fR[=\fIfilename\fR]

\fB\-\-extech\fR=\fIdevnode\fR
Use the Extech Power Analyzer for measurements.  This allows one to
specify the serial device node of the serial to USB adaptor connecting to

.IR /dev/ttyUSB0 .
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-html\fR[=\fIfilename\fR]
Generate an HTML report.  If a
.I filename
is not specified then the default name
.B powertop.html
is used.  The HTML report can be sent to others to help diagnose power
issues.
.TP

Number of times to run each test.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Suppress stderr output.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR[=\fIseconds\fR]
Generate a report for a specified number of
.IR seconds .
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-workload\fR[=\fIworkload\fR]
Execute
.I workload
file as a part of calibration before making a report.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
